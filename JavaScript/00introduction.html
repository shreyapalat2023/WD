                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building dynamic and
                interactive web pages.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used both on the client-side and server-side of web
            development.
            On the client-side, JavaScript is commonly used to add interactivity, validate forms, manipulate the DOM
            (Document Object Model), handle events, create animations, and much more within web browsers. On the
            server-side, JavaScript can be used with platforms like Node.js to build scalable and efficient server
            applications.</p>

                <summary><strong class="que">1.What do you understand about JavaScript?</strong></summary>
                <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on
                    web
                    pages.</p>
                <p>JavaScript comes from ECMAScript. ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, including
                    JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    ECMAScript defines what a scripting language should look like, while JavaScript is an actual
                    implementation of that specification.
                </p>
                <p>It is a client-side as well as server-side scripting language. Our source code can be read by browser
                    as
                    well as server. </p>
                <p>It takes code line by line and that is why it is called scripting language.</p>
                <p>It makes our webpages dynamic and interactive.</p>
                <p>With the use of JavaScript we can manipulate html and css. Without JavaScript your website looks
                    dull.It
                    is used in data validation.</p>
                <p>JavaScript enables you to creat dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images.
                </p>
                <p>World wide 95% people use this language.</p>

                    <summary> Language</summary>
                    <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language, meaning it is closer to human language than
                        machine
                        language, making it easier for developers to write and understand.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Interpreted Language:</summary>
                    <p>JavaScript code is executed line by line by an interpreter, typically embedded in web browsers.
                        This
                        allows for immediate feedback during development but can potentially lead to slower execution
                        compared to compiled languages.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Dynamic Typing</summary>
                    <p>JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. This
                        flexibility
                        allows for more fluid coding but can also lead to errors if types are not handled carefully.</p>

                    <summary>Prototype-based Object Orientation: </summary>
                    <p>JavaScript uses prototype-based object orientation rather than class-based. Objects can inherit
                        properties and methods directly from other objects, allowing for flexible and powerful object
                        manipulation.</p>

                    <p> JavaScript supports functional programming paradigms, allowing functions to be treated as
                        first-class citizens. This enables features such as higher-order functions, closures, and
                        anonymous

                    <summary>Event-driven and Asynchronous:</summary>
                    <p>JavaScript is inherently event-driven, allowing developers to define actions in response to user
                        interactions or system events. Additionally, JavaScript supports asynchronous programming
                        through
                        mechanisms such as callbacks, promises, and async/await, which is crucial for handling
                        operations

                        reduces
                        server load and improves responsiveness since much of the processing is done locally on the

                        HTML
                        elements, respond to user actions, and update content without requiring page reloads. This

                        crucial
                        for handling tasks such as fetching data from servers, processing user input, and performing

                </summary>
                <p>There are several ways to add JavaScript code to an HTML file:</p>
                <strong>Inline Script:</strong>
                <span>JavaScript code can be directly embedded within the HTML file using the 'script' tag. This method
                    is
                    known as inline scripting. Here's an example:</span>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="./inline_script_ex.html">Example</a></li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Internal Script:</strong>
                <span>JavaScript code can also be included within the script tags in the

                    <head> or body section of the HTML document. This method is known as internal scripting. Here's an
                        example:
                </span>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="internalscript.html">Example</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <strong>External Script:</strong>
                <span>JavaScript code can be placed in an external file with a .js extension and then included in the
                    HTML
                    file using the script tag's src attribute. This method is known as external scripting. Here's an
                    example:</span>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="externalscript.html">Example</a></li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Asynchronous Script Loading:</strong>
                <span>You can also load external scripts asynchronously by adding the async attribute to the script tag.
                    This allows the HTML parsing to continue while the script is being downloaded, which can improve
                    page
                    load performance. However, the order of execution may not be guaranteed.</span> <br> <br>

                <strong>Deferred Script Loading:</strong>
                <span>Similar to asynchronous loading, you can use the defer attribute to load external scripts
                    deferred,
                    meaning they will be executed after the HTML document has been parsed. Unlike async, deferred
                    scripts
                    maintain their order of execution. Example</span>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="12defer.html">Example</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>JavaScript provides several types of pop-up boxes for interacting with users. These include:</p>
                <strong>Alert Box:</strong>
                <span>This type of pop-up box is used to display a message to the user. It contains only one button,

                <p><strong>Confirm Box:</strong>
                    <span> This pop-up box is used to ask the user for confirmation. It contains two buttons, typically
                        labeled "OK" and "Cancel". It returns true if the user clicks "OK" and false if the user clicks
                        "Cancel".</span>

                <p><strong>Prompt Box:</strong>
                    <span>This pop-up box is used to prompt the user to input some data. It contains an input field for
                        the
                        user to enter text, along with "OK" and "Cancel" buttons. It returns the text entered by the

                        a string, or null if the user clicks "Cancel".</span>

                    interrupt
                    the user experience and may not be suitable for all scenarios. Additionally, their appearance and
                    behavior can vary across different browsers.</p>
