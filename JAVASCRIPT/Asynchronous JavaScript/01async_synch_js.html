     <h1>Synchronous and Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
     <h4>Synchronous:</h4>
     <p>Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the programm. Each instruction waits for the previous instructoin to completer its execution.</p>
     <h4>Asynchronous:</h4>
     <p>Due to synchronous programming, somethimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI. </p>
     <p>Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.</p>
