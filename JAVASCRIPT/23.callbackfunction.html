    <h1>Callback Function</h1>
    <p>
        A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the
        outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
    </p>
    <p>
        Callbacks allow you to handle the results of an asynchronous operation in a non-blocking manner, which means
        that
        the program can continue to run while the operation is being executed.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why use Callbacks?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Asynchronous operations are operations that take a significant amount of time to complete, such as network
        requests, file I/O, and database queries.
    </p>
    <p>
        If these operations were executed synchronously, the program would freeze and wait for the operation to complete
        before continuing.This can lead to a poor user experience, as the program would appear unresponsive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Callbacks allow you to continue executing code while the operation is being executed in the background. Once the
        operation has completed, the callback function is called with the result of the operation. This way, you can
        ensure that the program remains responsive and the user experience is not impacted.
    </p>
    <h3>Real-life Examples:</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Loading images on a website:</strong>
        When you load a website, images can take a while to load, especially if they're large. If images were loaded
        synchronously, the website would freeze and wait for each image to load before continuing. With callbacks, you
        can load the images asynchronously, which means that the website continues to load while the images are being
        loaded in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Handling form submissions:</strong>
        When a user submits a form, it takes time to process the data and send it to the server. If the form submission
        was executed synchronously, the user would have to wait for the data to be processed and sent before the form
        can be submitted. With callbacks, you can handle the form submission asynchronously, which means that the user
        can continue to interact with the form while the data is being processed and sent in the background
