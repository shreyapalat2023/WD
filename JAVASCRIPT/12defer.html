    <h1>Defer attribute:</h1>
    <p>This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document
        has been parsed, but before firing DOMContentLoaded.

    </p>
    <h3>Document: DOM ContentLoaded event</h3>
    <p>
        The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts
        have downloaded and executed. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to
        finish loading.
