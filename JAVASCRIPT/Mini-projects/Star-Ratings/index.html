    <h4>Here we use DOMContentLoaded event</h4>
    <p>These two events DOMContentLoaded and load are used to check when a webpage has loaded completely. Still, there
        are some factors that determine the preference of one over the other. Let’s have a look at both of them and
        understand their working.</p>
    <p>DOMContentLoaded event gets executed once the basic HTML document is loaded and its parsing has taken place. This
        event doesn’t wait for the completion of the loading of add-ons such as stylesheets, sub-frames and
        images/pictures.</p>
