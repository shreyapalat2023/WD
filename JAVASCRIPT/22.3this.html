        -The <strong>this</strong> keyword refers to the context where a piece of code, such as a function's body, is supposed to run.
        Most typically, it is used in object methods, where <strong>this</strong> refers to the object that the method is attached to,
        thus allowing the same method to be reused on different objects. 
    </p>

    <p>
        -The value of <strong>this</strong> in JavaScript depends on how a function is invoked (runtime binding), not how it is defined.
        When a regular function is invoked as a method of an object (obj.method()), this points to that object. When
        invoked as a standalone function (not attached to an object: func()), this typically refers to the global object
        (in non-strict mode) or undefined (in strict mode). The Function.prototype.bind() method can create a function
        whose this binding doesn't change, and methods apply() and call() can also set the this value for a particular
        call.
    </p>
    <p>
        -Arrow functions differ in their handling of <strong>this:</strong> they inherit this from the parent scope at the time they are
        defined. This behavior makes arrow functions particularly useful for callbacks and preserving context. However,
        arrow functions do not have their own this binding. Therefore, their this value cannot be set by bind(), apply()
        or call() methods, nor does it point to the current object in object methods.

        <h1>What the hell is this?</h1>
        -If you are coming from another language, which is Object-Oriented, such as Java, you are no doubt familiar with
        the concept of <mark>this</mark> keyword is used inside of a class and refers to the current instance. No more, no
        less.
    </p>

    <p>
        -In Javascript, this is yet another concept, which behaves in an unexpected way. Like other concepts such as new
        operator or classes, it tricks you into making some false assumptions based on concepts which you know from
        other languages. Because the syntax and naming are the same or very similar, yet the concept is different.
        What's more, its behavior is not the same depending on whether you are in the strict mode or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        -Every time a function is invoked, this is assigned a reference to an object based on how the function was
        called. Is it a regular function? A method called on an object? Fat arrow function? Method of an ES6 class?
        That's the key to understanding the topic. What's confusing about this is that the very same function can have a
        different value of this based on circumstances. Turns out that this does not depend on the function itself but
        rather on how the function is called. The same function will have different this when called as a method of an
        object and when provided as a callback function. You need to be careful because the functions can be passed
        around and in such case, this may be different from what you expected
