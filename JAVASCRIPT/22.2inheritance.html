    <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
        -In programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece
        of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using
        objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a
        prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has
        no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the
        prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in
        JavaScript.

        <li><strong>'extends' Keyword: </strong>Used to create a class that is a child of another class.</li>
        <li><strong>'super' Keyword:</strong>Used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access parent class methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Method Overriding:</strong>Child classes can override methods of the parent class to provide specific implementations.</li>
     </ol>
    <!-- KeyPoint END -->
    <p>-A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:</p>
    <p>
        -Although classes are now widely adopted and have become a new paradigm in JavaScript, classes do not bring a new
        inheritance pattern. While classes abstract most of the prototypal mechanism away, understanding how prototypes
        work under the hood is still useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        -Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to
        add more.
    </p>
    <p>
       - Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.
    </p>
    <p>
        -Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.
    </p>
    <p>
        -To use class inheritance, you use the extends keyword. For example,
