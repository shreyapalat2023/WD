    <h2>Practical Use Case:</h2>
    <p>Consider a scenario where you have a base class for Employee and specialized classes for Manager and Developer
    </p>
    <p>This example shows how you can use inheritance to create specific employee types with additional properties and
        behaviors while still sharing common functionality from the base class.</p>

    <h4>Base Class vs Derived Class</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Base class:</strong>This class has a constructor that initialized the "name" and "id" properties and
            a method "getDetails".</li>
        <li><strong>Derived Class:</strong>Here, We have Two Derived Classes Manager and Developer which inherit name
            and id properties of base class Employee. They both have their own constructor that calls the parent class's
            constructor using "super" keyword. It also add a "getDetails()" method and override the method in base
            class.</li>
    </ol>
