            <summary><strong class="que">1.What is a Variable ?</strong></summary>
            <p>Variables are used to store data in JavaScript. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are
                containers
                for values. The values of the variables are allocated using the assignment operator(“=”).</p>
            <p>A varibles stores data, lika a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a
                sentence.</p>
            <p>One special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything- not just strings and
                numbers.
                Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things.</p>

                <summary>Declaring a Variable:</summary>

                <p>
                    It simply means create a variable. for instance, <br>
                    let myName;
                    let myAge; <br>
                    Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge.
                </p>
                <p>They currently have no value; they are empty containers, When you enter the variables names, you
                    should
                    get value of undefined returned.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Initializing a Variable</summary>
                <p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the
                    variable
                    name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it</p>
                <p>For instance, <br>
                    myName = "Chris";
                    myAge = 37;

            <summary><strong class="que">2. What are the conventions of naming a variable in JavaScript?</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
                In JavaScript, variable names must adhere to certain conventions to ensure clarity, consistency, and
                maintainability of code. Here are the common conventions for naming variables in JavaScript:
            </p>

            <details>
                <summary>Use descriptive names: </summary>
                <p> Variable names should clearly convey their purpose or the data they hold. Avoid single-letter
                    variable
                    names (x, y, etc.) unless they are used as loop counters or in other specific contexts where their
                    meaning is obvious.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                // Good:
                var firstName = "John";
                var itemCount = 10;

                // Bad:
                var f = "John"; // Not descriptive
                var i = 10; // Not descriptive
            </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Use camelCase: </summary>
                <p> In JavaScript, it's conventional to use camelCase for variable names. Start with a lowercase letter,
                    and
                    capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word within the name. This convention applies to
                    variable
                    names, function names, and object property names.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                var userName = "john_doe";
                var itemCount = 10;
            </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Avoid reserved words: </summary>
                <p> Do not use JavaScript reserved words as variable names, as they have special meaning within the
                    language.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                // Bad:
                var var = "value"; // "var" is a reserved keyword
            </pre>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Use meaningful abbreviations: </summary>
                <p> While descriptive names are encouraged, it's acceptable to use common abbreviations as long as they
                    are
                    widely understood within the context of your codebase.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                var maxNum = 100; // "maxNum" is an abbreviation for "maximum number"
            </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Be consistent: </summary>
                <p> Maintain consistency in naming conventions throughout your codebase to improve readability and make
                    it
                    easier for others (or your future self) to understand the code</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Constants: </summary>
                <p> Use uppercase letters for constants to differentiate them from regular variables. Separate multiple
                    words with underscores.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                const MAX_COUNT = 100; 
            </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Constructor functions: </summary>
                <p> When defining constructor functions for objects, use PascalCase convention.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                function Car(make, model) {
                    this.make = make;
                    this.model = model;
                }
                var myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
                 const MAX_COUNT = 100; 
            </pre>

            <summary><strong class="que">3. How do you debug a JavaScript code?</strong></summary>
            <p> Debugging is the term that means examining the code, finding the error in the code, and fixing that
                error.
            </p>
            <p>It is common to have errors while writing codes and the errors can be due to syntax or logic. These
                errors
                create a lot of ambiguity in the logic and understanding of both users and programmers. There can also
                be
                errors in the code which can remain invisible to the programmer’s eye and can create havoc. To identify
                these errors we need Debuggers that can go through the entire code or program, identify the errors and
                also
                fix them.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Console.log():</summary>
                <p>One of the simplest and most widely used debugging techniques is to insert console.log() statements
                    at
                    various points in your code to output values of variables, objects, or messages to the browser
                    console.
                    This allows you to inspect the state of your code and track the flow of execution.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                console.log("Value of x:", x);

                <summary>Browser Developer Tools:</summary>
                <p>Modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools that include powerful debugging capabilities.
                    You
                    can open the developer tools by pressing F12 or right-clicking on a webpage and selecting "Inspect"
                    or
                    "Inspect Element". Within the developer tools, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set breakpoints: Pause code execution at specific points to inspect variables and step through
                        your
                        code line by line.</li>
                    <li>Examine variable values: View the current values of variables and objects in different scopes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Debugging console: Access the console to log messages and evaluate expressions.</li>
                    <li>Network monitoring: Analyze network requests and responses.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Debugger Statement:</summary>
                <p>You can insert the debugger statement directly into your JavaScript code to pause execution and
                    launch
                    the browser's debugger when that line of code is reached. This is useful for situations where you
                    want
                    to debug specific parts of your code without modifying it.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>
                function myFunction() {
                    debugger;
                    // Code to be debugged
                }
            </pre>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Step Through Code:</summary>
                <p>Once your code is paused at a breakpoint, you can step through it line by line to observe how
                    variables
                    change and identify any issues. This helps you understand the flow of execution and pinpoint the
                    exact
                    location of bugs</p>
            </details>

                <summary>Debugging Tools in IDEs:</summary>
                <p> Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, and others offer
                    advanced debugging features that can enhance your debugging workflow. These tools often provide
                    features

            <p>
                In JavaScript, both let and var are used for variable declaration, but they have some key differences:
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Scope:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>var is function-scoped. This means that variables declared with var are scoped to the function
                        in
                        which they are declared or, if declared outside of any function, to the global scope.</li>
                    <li>let is block-scoped. Variables declared with let are scoped to the nearest enclosing block,
                        whether
                        it's a loop, an if statement, or any other block.</li>

            <details>
                <summary>Hoisting:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. This means
                        that you can access and use the variable before it's declared in the code, but its value will be
                        undefined.</li>
                    <li>Variables declared with let are also hoisted, but they are not initialized until their
                        declaration
                        statement is evaluated. Accessing a let variable before its declaration (within the same block)
                        results in a ReferenceError.</li>

            <p>In JavaScript, there are several ways to define variables, each with its own characteristics and use

            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>var:</summary>
                <p>The traditional way of defining variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with var are
                    function-scoped
                    or globally scoped, hoisted to the top of their scope, and can be re-declared and re-assigned.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>var x = 10;</pre>

                <summary>let:</summary>
                <p> Introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), let allows for block-scoped variables. Variables declared with let
                    are
                    limited to the block, statement, or expression in which they are defined. They are hoisted to the
                    top of
                    their block but are not initialized until their declaration is evaluated.</p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>let y = 20;</pre>

                <summary>const:</summary>
                <p> Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare constants, which are block-scoped like variables
                    declared with let. The value of a const variable cannot be re-assigned once initialized. However, if
                    the
                    value is an object or array, its properties or elements can still be modified. </p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>const PI = 3.14;</pre>

                <summary>Implicit declaration:</summary>
                <p> If you assign a value to a variable without declaring it using var, let, or const, JavaScript will
                    create an implicit global variable. However, it's considered bad practice because it can lead to
                    naming
                    conflicts and make code harder to understand and maintain. </p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>implicitVar = "Implicit global variable";</pre>

            <p>In JavaScript, imports and exports are mechanisms for modularizing code and facilitating the organization
                and
                reuse of functionality across different parts of a program or multiple programs.</p>

                        <strong>Exporting:</strong>
                        <span> This is the process of making variables, functions, or objects available for use in other
                            JavaScript files or modules.</span>

                    <li><strong>Exporting Named Entities:</strong>
                        <span> You can export individual variables, functions, or objects by using the export keyword
                            followed by the name of the entity you want to export.</span>

            <p>
                Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of
                their
                containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use
                variables and functions before they are declared in your code. However, it's important to note that only
                the
                declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or assignments.
            </p>
            <h3>JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted</h3>
            <p>In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.</p>
            <p>In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.</p>

            </details>
            <h3>The let and const Keywords</h3>

                    var x = 5;
                </pre>
                <p>In the above example, even though the variable x is declared and initialized on the second line, the
                    console.log statement doesn't throw an error. Instead, it outputs undefined. This is because the
                    declaration of x is hoisted to the top of its containing scope during compilation.</p>

                <p>In this example, the foo() function is called before its declaration in the code. Despite this, the
                    code
                    runs successfully and outputs "Hello, World!". This is because function declarations are hoisted to

            <p>Implicit type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic conversion of values from one data type to
                another by the JavaScript engine during runtime. This occurs when an operation involving different data
                types is performed. JavaScript will attempt to convert one or both of the values to a common data type
                before executing the operation. Implicit type coercion can be convenient but may lead to unexpected

                let a = 5;
                let b = "10";
                let result = a + b; // Result: "510"
            </pre>
            <p>In this example, JavaScript implicitly coerces the number 5 to a string to perform concatenation rather
                than
                arithmetic addition.</p>
            <p>Example 2: Equality Operator (==):</p>
            <pre>
                let num = 10;
                let str = "10";
                console.log(num == str); // Result: true
            </pre>
            <p>In this example, JavaScript implicitly coerces the string "10" to a number to check for equality with the
                numeric value 10.</p>
            <p>Example 3: Logical Operators (&&, ||, !):</p>
            <pre>
                console.log(10 && 20); // Result: 20
                console.log("" || "Hello"); // Result: "Hello"
                console.log(!true); // Result: false
    
            </pre>
            <p>In these examples, JavaScript implicitly coerces the operands to boolean values (true or false) before
                performing the logical operation.</p>
            <p>Example 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator (? :):</p>
            <pre>
            let x = 10;
            let y = "5";
            let result = x > y ? "x is greater" : "y is greater"; // Result: "x is greater"
        </pre>
            <p>Here, JavaScript implicitly coerces the string "5" to a number to perform the comparison.</p>

            </summary>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.</p>
            <p>In statically typed languages, variable types are explicitly declared and checked at compile time. Once a
                variable is declared with a specific type, its type cannot be changed</p>
            <p>In dynamically typed languages like JavaScript, variable types are determined at runtime. You don't need
                to
                declare the type of a variable explicitly. Instead, the type of a variable is inferred based on the
                value
                assigned to it, and it can change over the course of the program's execution.</p>

            <summary><strong class="que">12. NaN property in JavaScript</strong></summary>
            <p>In JavaScript, NaN is a global property representing "Not-A-Number." It indicates that a value is not a
                legal
                number. The NaN property is a special value of the global object and is of the type "number".</p>
            <p><strong>Characteristics of NaN:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Type:</strong>
                    <span>Despite its name, NaN is a number data type.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Indication:</strong>
                    <span> It indicates that an operation or function resulted in an unrepresentable value.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>NaN Comparison: </strong>
                    <span>NaN is not equal to any other value, including itself. This is because NaN is considered as a
                        unique value that is not equal to anything, including itself.</span>
                    <p>Example</p>
                    <pre>
                        console.log(NaN === NaN); // Output: false
                    </pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common Causes of NaN:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performing arithmetic operations involving non-numeric values or undefined results in NaN.</li>
                <li>Parsing non-numeric strings using parseInt() or parseFloat() may result in NaN.</li>
                <li>Mathematical operations that result in undefined values, such as dividing zero by zero, result in
                    NaN.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Checking for NaN:
                </strong></p>
            <p>You can use the isNaN() function to determine if a value is NaN.</p>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
                  console.log(isNaN("Hello")); // Output: true
                  console.log(isNaN(5)); // Output: false

        <summary><strong class="que">13. Passed by value and passed by reference</strong></summary>
        <p>"Passed by value" and "passed by reference" are concepts that describe how data is transferred between
            variables or functions in programming languages, including JavaScript.</p>

        <details>
            <summary><strong>Passed by Value:</strong></summary>
            <ul>
                <li>In "passed by value," a copy of the variable's value is passed to a function or assigned to another
                    variable.</li>
                <li>Modifications to the parameter or variable inside the function do not affect the original value
                    outside the function.</li>
                <li>This behavior is typical for primitive data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans in
                    JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
                function modifyValue(x) {
                    x = 10;
                }
                
                let y = 5;
                modifyValue(y);
                console.log(y); // Output: 5 (unchanged)
            </pre>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Passed by Reference:</strong></summary>
            <ul>
                <li>In "passed by reference," the memory address (reference) of the variable is passed to a function or
                    assigned to another variable.</li>
                <li>Changes made to the parameter or variable inside the function affect the original value outside the
                    function because they are referring to the same memory location.</li>
                <li>This behavior is typical for complex data types such as arrays and objects in JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
                function modifyArray(arr) {
                    arr.push(4);
                }
                
                let myArray = [1, 2, 3];
                modifyArray(myArray);
                console.log(myArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4] (modified)
