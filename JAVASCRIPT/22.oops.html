        <h1 id="scrollspyHeading1">Object Oriented Programming Structure/System</h1>
        <p>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that
            use
            objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance,
            hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions
            that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>OOP is a programming paradigm where problems are modeled in the form of classes and objects. The main
                focus
                is on the data (object) rather than on the procedure or the functions used to manipulate that data.</li>
            <li>An object is an abstract representation of things and concepts we encounter in the real world, such as
                employees, organizations, cars, electronics, or anything you can think of. And a class is a blueprint
                for
                creating objects.</li>
            <li>Thus, classes are small chunks of reusable code from which multiple objects can be created. This makes
                programs written using OOP easy to execute, modify, and debug. Thus, object-oriented programming is very
                useful for building large and complex software.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h1 id="scrollspyHeading2">Building Blocks of OOP</h1>
        <p>
        <p>
            To understand how OOP works, we first need to know its components. Once we do that, we can explore how the
            core
            OOP principles are applied to these components.
        </p>
        <!-- Class START -->
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Classes</strong></summary>
            <p>
                A class is a blueprint for objects. It is like the technical design of a house or a car. In such
                designs,
                you specify the features of the house. Using those features as a guide, you can then build as many
                houses as
                you want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Classes and objects work in a similar way. If you want to create a program that processes information
                about
                your employees, you will need to start by creating an Employee class.
            </p>
            <p>This class will contain</p>
            <ul>
                <li>employee data in the form of variables (name, salary, job position, etc.) and</li>
                <li>methods to process that data (calculating bonus, evaluating performance, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
        <!--Class END  -->
        <!--Object START  -->
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Objects</strong></summary>
            <p>
                Once we've created a class, we can create objects from the class. An object is like a real house or a
                real
                car that you make from the blueprint.

            </p>
            <p>A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and methods).</p>
            <p>JS objects have a special property called prototype.</p>
            <p>We can set prototype using _ _proto_ _</p>
            <p>
                <span style="color: red;">Note:</span>
                If object & prototype have same method, object's method will be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can make as many objects as you want from a class. For example, if you have a class named Employee,
                you
                can make objects <strong>employee1, employee2, ..., employeeN.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of these objects is an individual instance of the Employee class. So it has its own individual data
                that is separate from other objects of the class. The figure below illustrates this point.
            </p>
            <div class="imgg">
                <img class="image" src="./img/class-object.png" alt="image">
            </div>

            <p>
                Now, each Employee object will have its own copy of name, salary, and the calculate_bonus() method. This
                is
                how we can model real-world concepts using classes and objects.
            </p>

                <strong>Attributes</strong>
            </summary>
            <p>
                These are the data or information associated with the object. In the Employee class we've described
                above,
                name and salary are the class attributes since they give the required information on the objects.
            </p>
        </details>
        <!--Attributes END  -->
        <!--Methods START  -->
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Methods</strong></summary>
            <p>
                These are the procedures and logic that are used to manipulate the object data or attributes. Methods
                can
                also be used to create new information about that object.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our Employee class, we have included a method named calculate_bonus() to calculate the bonus received
                by
                an employee.
            </p>

            <summary class="que"><strong>1. How do you create an object in JavaScript?</strong></summary>
            <p>In JavaScript, you can create objects using several methods.</p>
            <p>Here are a few common ways:</p>
            <h4>Object Literal</h4>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
            var myObject = {
                property1: value1,
                property2: value2,
                method1: function() {
                    // method implementation
                }
            };
        </pre>
            <h4>Using the new keyword with a Constructor Function</h4>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
            function Person(name, age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
                this.sayHello = function() {
                    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
                };
            }
            
            var person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
        </pre>
            <h4>Using Object.create() with a Prototype Object:</h4>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
            var personProto = {
                sayHello: function() {
                    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
                }
            };

            person1.name = "Alice";

            <summary class="que"><strong>2.What is the this keyword in JavaScript?</strong></summary>

            <p>
                In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value is
                determined by how a function is called, rather than where it's written in the code. The value of this is
                dynamic and can change based on different factors:
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>Global Context:</summary>
                <p>
                    In the global scope (outside of any function), this refers to the global object (window in browsers,
                    global in Node.js).

            <details>
                <summary>Function context:</summary>
                <p>
                    Inside a function, this usually refers to the object that the function is a method of.
                </p>
                <p>Example</p>
                <pre>

                <p>
                    When a function is used as a constructor with the new keyword, this refers to the newly created
                    instance.

            <summary class="que "><strong>3. What are object prototypes</strong></summary>
            <p>Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.</p>
            <p>
                JavaScript prototypes are used to access the properties and methods of objects. Inherited
                properties are originally defined in the prototype or parent object. The Date object is
                inherited from Date.prototype, Array object inherits from Array.prototype, etc. The prototypes
                may be used to add new properties and methods to the existing objects and object constructor.
            </p>
            <h4>The prototype chain</h4>
            <pre>
                let myObje = {
                    city : "Madrid",

            </pre>
            <p>
                This is an object with one data property, city, and one method, greet(). If you type the
                object's name followed by a period into the console, like myObject., then the console will pop
                up a list of all the properties available to this object. You'll see that as well as city and
                greet, there are lots of other properties!
            </p>
            <h4>What are these extra properties, and where do they come from?</h4>
            <p>
                Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype
                is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a
                prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
            </p>
            <p><strong style="color: red;">Note:</strong>The property of an object that points to its prototype
                is not called prototype. Its name is not standard, but in practice all browsers use __proto__.
                The standard way to access an object's prototype is the Object.getPrototypeOf() method.

            </p>
            <p>When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the
                prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's
                prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached,
                in which case undefined is returned.</p>

            <summary class="que"><strong> 4. Use of a constructor function (with examples)</strong></summary>
            <p>A constructor function in JavaScript is a function used for creating and initializing objects. It serves
                as a blueprint for creating multiple instances of similar objects. Here's an example of how to use a
                constructor function:</p>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
                    // Define a constructor function for creating Person objects
                    function Person(name, age) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.age = age;
                    }

                    // Create instances of Person using the constructor function
                   let person1 = new Person('John', 30);
                   let person2 = new Person('Alice', 25);

                   // Accessing properties of the created objects
                   console.log(person1.name); // Output: John
                   console.log(person2.age);  // Output: 25
            </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>We define a constructor function Person which takes name and age parameters and assigns them to the
                    respective properties of the created object (this.name and this.age).</li>
                <li>We create two instances of the Person object using the new keyword followed by the constructor
                    function name.</li>
                <li>We then access the properties of the created objects using dot notation (person1.name, person2.age).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <summary class="que"><strong>5. Prototypal vs Classical Inheritance</strong></summary>
            <p>Prototypal and classical inheritance are two different approaches to implementing inheritance in
                object-oriented programming.</p>
            <!-- Protypal Inheritance START -->
            <h4>Protypal Inheritance:</h4>
            <p>
                In prototypal inheritance, objects inherit directly from other objects. Each object has an internal link
                to another object called its prototype. If a property or method is not found on the object itself,
                JavaScript looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or method or reaches the end of the
                chain (the base object).
            </p>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
                    // Parent object (prototype)
                    var mammal = {
                        vertebrate: true,
                        breathe: function() {
                            console.log("Inhale... Exhale...");
                        }
                    };
                    
                    // Child object inheriting from parent
                    var cat = Object.create(mammal);
                    cat.meow = function() {
                        console.log("Meow!");
                    };
                    
                    // Test
                    cat.breathe(); // Inhale... Exhale...
                    cat.meow();    // Meow!
                    
                </pre>
            <p>
                In this example, mammal is a prototype object with a breathe method. We create a new object cat using
                Object.create(), inheriting from mammal. Then, we add a new method meow to the cat object. cat inherits
                the breathe method from its prototype.
            </p>
            <!-- Protypal Inheritance END -->
            <!-- Classical Inheritance START -->
            <h4>Classical Inheritance:</h4>
            <p>
                Classes act as blueprints for creating objects. Objects inherit properties and behaviors from classes
                through a hierarchical structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this model, classes are used to create objects, and inheritance is achieved through class-based
                relationships. Subclasses inherit properties and behaviors from their parent classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Classical inheritance often involves concepts like polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance
                hierarchies.
            </p>
            <p>Example</p>
            <pre>
