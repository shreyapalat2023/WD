        const students = ["shraddha", "sapna", "swapnil", "kaif", "Annapurna", "Shivani", "Shivangi", "Bhakti", "Ravindranathan", "angali", "Krishnanendu", "Emanuel"];

        houses = []

        for (const student of students) {

            if (student.length < 6) {
                houses.push("Gryffindor");
            } else if (student.length < 8) {
                houses.push("Huffleipuff");
            } else if (student.length <= 12) {
                houses.push("Ravenclaw");
            } else {
                houses.push("Slytherin");
            }
        }

        console.log(houses);
