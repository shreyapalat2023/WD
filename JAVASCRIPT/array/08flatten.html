    <h1>Write a method that turns a deep array into a plain array.</h1>
    <p>JavaScript also provides a built-in method flat() that can flatten an array up to a specified depth. To fully flatten a deeply nested array, you can use:</p>
    <p>flat(Infinity): The flat() method flattens the array to the specified depth. By passing Infinity, you ensure that all levels of nested arrays are flattened into a single array.</p>
    <script>
        const deepArray = [1,[2,[3,4],5],6];
        const flatArray = deepArray.flat(Infinity);
        console.log(deepArray);
        console.log(flatArray);
        
        
    </script>
