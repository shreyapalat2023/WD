    <h1>Write a method that creates an array of unique values that are included in all given
        arrays.</h1>
    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start with the First Array.</strong></li>
        <ul>

            <li>We begin with the first array (acc initially). This is the starting point.</li>
            <li>acc stands for <mark>accumulator</mark> and second parameter stands for next element of arrays.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Check Each Array One by One:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>For each array in the input, we look at the current list of common elements (acc) and filter it down to
                only those elements that also exist in the next array (array).</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Filter to Keep Only Common Elements:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The filter method checks each element in the current list (acc) to see if it's in the next array
                (array).</li>
            <li>If it is, the element stays in the list; if not, it's removed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> <strong>Repeat Until All Arrays Are Processed:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>This process continues until all arrays are processed. The final result is a list of elements that
                appear in every array.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <script>
        const intersection = (...arrays) => {
            return arrays.reduce((acc, array) => {
                return acc.filter(element => array.includes(element));
            })
        }
        const intersectionArrayOne = intersection([1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 6], [3, 4, 5]);
        const intersectionArrayTwo = intersection([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 8, 9, 10]);
        console.log(intersectionArrayOne);
        console.log(intersectionArrayTwo);
